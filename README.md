Translation resources for Green Screens 5250 Mobile application

As our mobile application Green Screens 5250 Terminal reached stable status during the last year, we decided to finally implement multiple languages support for user interface. 
Thus, we created auto translation tool for Android string resource files to help us translate user interface into 35 languages with the help of Google Translate API service. 
As some automatic translations might not be quite correct, we released all string resources to the GitHub.

If you are interested to improve our mobile app translation for your language or simply want to add your own language into the application, link to the resources are below. 
Feel free to send us corrections through email or GitHub patch feature. After reviewing, we might add your language to the next release.
